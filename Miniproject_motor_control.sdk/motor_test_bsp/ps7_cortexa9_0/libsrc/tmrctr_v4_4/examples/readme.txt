/** \page example Examples
You can refer to the below stated example applications for more details on how to use tmrctr driver.

@section ex1 xtmrctr_fast_intr_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTmrctr driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the timer counter driver(XTmCtr)
and hardware device using fast interrupt mode.

For details, see xtmrctr_fast_intr_example.c.

@section ex2 xtmrctr_intr_64bit_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTmrctr driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the timer counter driver(XTmCtr)
and hardware device using interrupt mode with the counters configured in
cascasde mode for a 64 bit operation. Both the timers should enabled in
HW configuration for the cascade mode of operation.

For details, see xtmrctr_intr_64bit_example.c.

@section ex3 xtmrctr_intr_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTmrctr driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the timer counter driver(XTmCtr)
and hardware device using interrupt mode.

For details, see xtmrctr_intr_example.c.

@section ex4 xtmrctr_low_level_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTmrctr driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the Timer Counter(XTmrCtr)
low level driver and hardware device in a polled mode.

For details, see xtmrctr_low_level_example.c.

@section ex5 xtmrctr_polled_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTmrctr driver directly.
This example shows the usage of the Timer Counter driver(XTmrCtr)
and hardware device in a polled mode.

For details, see xtmrctr_polled_example.c.

@section ex6 xtmrctr_selftest_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTmrctr driver directly.
This example performs the selftest using the timer counter driver.

For details, see xtmrctr_selftest_example.c.

@section ex7 xtmrctr_pwm_example.c
Contains an example on how to use the XTmrctr driver directly.
This example shows the usage of tmrctr PWM APIs to generate PWM output.
The example configures PWM to operate at specific duty cycle. After
every certain number of cycles the duty cycle is incremented until maximum
duty cycle is achieved.

For details, see xtmrctr_pwm_example.c.
