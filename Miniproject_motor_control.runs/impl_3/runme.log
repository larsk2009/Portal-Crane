If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

WARNING: [DRC DPOR-1] Asynchronous load check: DSP Block_design_i/acs_crane_ip_0/U0/u_acs_crane_ip_dut_inst/u_acs_crane_ip_src_Subsystem1/Multiply_mul_temp output is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset (Block_design_i/pwm_prog_0/U0/r_pwm_width_reg[0]). This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
